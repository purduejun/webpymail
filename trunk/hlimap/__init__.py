'''High Level IMAP Lib

Introduction
============

This is a high level, object oriented library to handle IMAP connections from
python programs. It aims to hide the awkwardness of the imaplib shipped with
python.

This library only exports the L{ImapServer<ImapServer>} class.

ImapServer Class
================

class hlimap.ImapServer( host='localhost', port=None, ssl=False, keyfile=None,
                         certfile=None )

This class establishes the connection to the IMAP server. When instantiated the
resulting object can be used to access the folder tree and the messages.

Methods:

ImapServer.login(username, password) - Authenticates against the server.

ImapServer.set_special_folders(*folder_list) - stores the special folders, this
            information is used by the sort method. The special folders appear
            first on the folder list. 

ImapServer.set_expand_list(*folder_list) - stores the folders to expand. Just
            as with the special folders, this is used when iterating through
            the folders. Only the folders set to expand will have their sub
            folders displayed.

ImapServer.refresh_folders(subscribed = True) - Extracts the folder list from 
            the server. Retrieving the folder list is a lazy operation. If we
            want to access a single folder, we simply select it, so it's not
            necessary to retrieve the complete list.

ImapServer.set_folder_iterator() -  Sets the iterator to use when going through
            the folders. There are available several iterators defined on the
            FolderTree class.
            TODO: This iterator selection mechanism should be remade. This 
            method is used only internally to the ImapServer class, however it's
            useful to change the iterator on the fly (that was the original
            objective), the current method is awkward.

ImapServer.__del__() - logs out of the imap server when the ImapServer instance
            is deleted.

ImapServer.__getitem__(path) - get a Folder object.

ImapServer.__iter__() - Iterates through the user accessible folders.

First we have to create an instance of L{ImapServer<ImapServer>}, and login only
the server:
